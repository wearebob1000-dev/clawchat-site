    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 5, 2026</p>

    <h2>Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By downloading or using ClawChat AI ("ClawChat"), you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, do not use the app.</p>

    <h2>Description of Service</h2>
    <p>ClawChat is an AI companion app that uses Anthropic's Claude language model to have voice and text conversations. The app stores your data locally on your device.</p>

    <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>FREE</strong> - 10 messages per day at no cost.</li>
      <li><strong>PRO</strong> - $14.99/month for 100 messages per day, persistent memory, and iCloud sync.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>PRO subscriptions are billed monthly through Apple. You can cancel anytime in your iPhone Settings under Subscriptions. Cancellation takes effect at the end of your current billing period.</p>

    <h2>Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to use ClawChat to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Generate illegal, harmful, or abusive content</li>
      <li>Attempt to circumvent rate limits or security measures</li>
      <li>Reverse engineer or interfere with the service</li>
      <li>Impersonate others or misrepresent your identity</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>AI Limitations</h2>
    <p>Bob is an AI. He can make mistakes, provide inaccurate information, or misunderstand context. Do not rely on ClawChat for medical, legal, financial, or safety-critical decisions. Always verify important information independently.</p>

    <h2>Experimental Service</h2>
    <p><strong>ClawChat is an experimental, early-stage service.</strong> By using ClawChat, you acknowledge and accept that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The service may experience downtime, interruptions, or outages at any time without notice</li>
      <li>Features may change, be modified, or be removed without prior warning</li>
      <li>The AI may produce unexpected, inaccurate, or inconsistent responses</li>
      <li>We rely on third-party services (including Anthropic's Claude API) that are outside our control and may experience their own outages or changes</li>
      <li>Your usage data and memories stored on your device may be affected by app updates or technical issues</li>
      <li>We make no guarantees regarding uptime, reliability, accuracy, or continued availability of the service</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Use ClawChat at your own risk. This is not a production-grade service and should not be relied upon for critical, time-sensitive, or mission-critical purposes.</p>

    <h2>Availability</h2>
    <p>We strive to keep ClawChat available but do not guarantee uninterrupted service. We may modify, suspend, or discontinue features at any time without liability.</p>

    <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>ClawChat and its design are the property of ClawChat AI. Your conversations and data belong to you.</p>

    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>ClawChat is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.</p>
    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, ClawChat AI and its operators shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, revenue, data, or use, arising out of or related to your use of ClawChat, including but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Service interruptions, downtime, or unavailability</li>
      <li>Inaccurate, misleading, or harmful AI responses</li>
      <li>Loss of data, memories, or conversation history</li>
      <li>Third-party service failures (including AI providers)</li>
      <li>Any actions taken based on AI-generated content</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In no event shall our total liability exceed the amount you paid for the service in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim, or $50 USD, whichever is less.</p>

    <h2>Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these terms from time to time. Continued use of ClawChat after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.</p>
